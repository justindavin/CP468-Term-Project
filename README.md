# CP468-Term-Project
## Dataset
The dataset is retrieved from kaggle at: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset
## Goal
The goal of this project is to predict whether or not a patient is having a stroke based on the input parameters such as gender, age, various diseases, and smoking status. Each row in the data provides relevant information about the patient.
## Installation and execution steps
There are several libraries that will be used in this project such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, etc. To install these libraries, type in pip install "library" to install the libraries that are in use. To execute the code, run the code from top to bottom.
## Results and Conclusion
4 machine learning models were used in this project: Decision trees, Random Forest, K-nearest neighbors, and Logistic regression. The different performance measures used were accuracy, precision, and recall.
Overall the best performing model was the Random forest classifier with an accuracy of 96.8%.
